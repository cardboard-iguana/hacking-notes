# Using CUPP
The **Common User Passwords Profiler** (`sudo apt install cupp` on Kali Linux) can generate potential password lists based on personal data (birthday, petâ€™s name, etc.). It can be run in an automated fashion, or will ask you appropriate questions for a specific target when invoked as `cupp -I`.

Using `cupp -l` will also download pre-created lists in a variety of languages.

Using `cupp -a` will download lists of known default passwords.
